# BJ | By players, for players
First project | BlackJack in Python

- *My idea is basically to make a blackjack to play against a bot, or in a duo.This will pass to the big "leagues" so to speak. Start by doing something basic, either by console, then graphical interface, and then already to a 2D or 3D game. All this is published in a GITHUB destined this*

# GUI - Example

â™£ BlackJack | Menu â™ 

--> Solitario (ðŸ¤–) | Beta 1.0v

--> Duo (ðŸ‘«) | Alpha 0.1v

--> Online (ðŸŽ®) | Coming Soon

--> Exit (ðŸ’¨)

**I would start with a very simple interface HIT, STAND and a DISPLAY where it shows your value
and the BOT. Before this would be the interface of what game mode you want to play**

# TIME DIAGRAM

- Create the basics, the solitaire/duo game, and make it work.
- Then try to pass it to a much friendlier Graphical Interface.
- Try to make it 2D or 3D
- Create ONLINE mode, from a database with a score/ranking.
